# Prototyping in the browser II

In the previous session (I-tools) we have taken a rough look at all major components involved in this particular method of ’prototyping in the browser’. We have also tried to set our systems up, install all necessary software and create a basic project with serve.

This session will take a closer look at some of the tools (namely HAML & SASS), explain some basic processes and give hopfully a few hours time to work together on the individual prototype projects.
